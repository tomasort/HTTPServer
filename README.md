# HTTP Server

An server implemented using python and the Sockets module. It can set and accept cookies from the client and perform certain actions such as fetching the file with the language specified in the cookies. 

# Requirements

At the moment this server only works with python 2. I'm working on Updating the project to work with python3. 
To run the server do `python WebServer.py`
